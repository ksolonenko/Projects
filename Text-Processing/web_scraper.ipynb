But we were seated shortly after and directed to access their wifi and menu online.<br/><br/>We ordered several items...<br/><br/>Mango slaw... favorite dish<br/>Pad see ew noodles with tofu and veggies <br/>Fried rice with shrimp <br/>Vegan seafood dish<br/>Pangang curry with tofu and veggies <br/>Green tea... pretty light in taste but hot which was appreciated on a cold, windy night.<br/><br/>The dishes were generously plated, smokey, and hit the spot. <br/><br/>The restaurant itself is like walking into a cabana. The music is thumping, the servers are schlepping items back and forth, the tables and bar are buzzing with conversation. It was a fun way to close out our visit to the city.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">I enjoyed the spring rolls and the Pad See Ew. I like spice and asked for it but I am glad I didn't pour it on. <br/><br/>The lime, when freshly squeezed on the meal makes it go pop! I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. At first I thought I wanted it spicy but the flavor was fantastic as it was. The lime really made the dish come to life. Pan cut noodles, veggies and I ordered with shrimp but you can get with chicken, beef, etc.<br/><br/>I waited a few days to eat here. I came on a weekday afternoon around 3 and no line. Still full from lunch but no line to wait to get to a table. Full menu, full bar. Service was fast and efficient. Menu is online and QR  odes at the table. No menu handouts.  <br/><br/>Smartly decorated like other Thai restaurants. <br/><br/>Would highly recommend!! Worth the wait of days and if limited time worth the wait as well.</span></p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-x4y0dd\" data-font-weight=\"semibold\"><a class=\"yelp-emotion-dcq3ik\" href=\"/biz_photos/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?userid=CqQuA6sT1_CmNJWR3qkzeg\">See all photos from Paul P. for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen</a></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf truncated__09f24__IiW9r yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Highly recommended restaurant. Reservations required. Walk ins have to wait an hour + if they can fit you in.

Which was actually great because it was a huge table and we had our own corner that was a lot roomier than most tables.<br/><br/>The winning dish was the mango salad- so fresh and flavorful! The other dishes, pad Thai, pad see ew, and Panang curry were all good-I think we were expecting a little more or different with the Michelin hype.<br/><br/>The ambience of the place is very fun and lively-it's in the basement of a building and feels like a semi tropical hideaway. Service was also good.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">there's a reason why this place has a Michelin award. All of our meals are so so good and coming from LA, I was not disappointed to pick one of my meals in Toronto to go to this place.<br/><br/>we went in on Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed, but we only had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes. They will text you when the table is ready.  Place is quite large. I didn't notice that from the outside have a lot of tables for the groups and pairs.<br/><br/>All of the food are awesome and I recommend you to go here if you visit Toronto. The staff are so nice too. I didn't try their tom yum because you can't really customize the spicy level and I can't really eat spicy food.</span></p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-x4y0dd\" data-font-weight=\"semibold\"><a class=\"yelp-emotion-dcq3ik\" href=\"/biz_photos/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?userid=5R2eEansfD5FWn29GVBmrQ\">See all photos from Novia E. for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen</a></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Avoid it.<br/>Unfortunately I didn't enjoy much the food. The wait time is too long and the service is bad too. The platter is a disaster, I simply won't recommend it. It's expensive and only look good for picture.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Pai has hands down the best pad thai i've had. I can't think of a better pad thai place in both Toronto and the states, even those in LA or NYC. The tom yum is also so flavorful and delicious. The wait can be a while if you didn't reserve a spot. Highly recommend stopping by for some thai food if you're in the city!</span></p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-10bskqf\" data-font-weight=\"bold\">Tom Yum</p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-10bskqf\" data-font-weight=\"bold\">Pad Thai</p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">This place is definitely packed 24/7 and super duper loud!<br/><br/>Came here before 5pm and was told there's already a 20 mins wait.  However, got a text message in less than 10 mins so it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>The seats/tables were small and I had multiple bags with me so it made it extra difficult to sit.  People also kept walking behind me and knocking off my belongings.  I wish I had the a seat against the wall but oh wells...<br/><br/>Ordered few things to try.  The pork skewer was the bomb! The chicken curry was good but the bamboo rice wasn't enough to finish the whole curry dish.  We ended up ordering another rice to go with it.  The tom yum soup was tasty.  The pad thai with beef was chewy.  The beef was super overcooked and it tasted like liver?  The thai tea was super cold and sweet.<br/><br/>Don't think I'll come back to this location, but perhaps the one in midtown.  We were super thirsty after dinner...</span></p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-x4y0dd\" data-font-weight=\"semibold\"><a class=\"yelp-emotion-dcq3ik\" href=\"/biz_photos/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?userid=46_hoG1edSoTrtfGvmQKRg\">See all photos from Connie C. for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen</a></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">This place exceeded my expectations. By far the best, freshest, Thai food I have had in my life. Service was amazing. Drinks were killer. The food had my mouth watering the whole time. I was excited for the next dish to come out. Ambiance is fun and trendy. <br/><br/>We ordered the pad Thai, the pad see ew noodles, spring rolls and the moo-ping. Everything was full of flavor, piping hot, and mouth watering. Cocktails were amazing as well - my favorite being the Thai mojito. <br/><br/>They have reservations available for you to make but I love that they cut back their reservation amount to accommodate more walk in guests. They really know what they are doing. Just a lovely experience.</span></p>, <p class=\"yelp-emotion-x4y0dd\" data-font-weight=\"semibold\"><a class=\"yelp-emotion-dcq3ik\" href=\"/biz_photos/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5?userid=_GDLCcA9ARVB5PGxHZud3w\">See all photos from Sarah M. for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen</a></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">This is a dimly lit, noisy, and popping place, so be forewarn. I did appreciate that they had a small waiting area and all staff was working efficiently to get guests in and out. The menu is typical of your usual Thai restaurant. The Khao Soi was bit too thick and sweet in my opinion. The egg noodles was surprisingly better than i had anticipated in this dish though. The Thai chicken wings were mediocre at best. Nevertheless, the dip definitely brought this dish up a notch. We should have done without the Pad Gra Prow - crispy pork. Other than the pieces of crispy pork, everything was very mediocre about this dish. This was our first time here and will probably be our last.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf yelp-emotion-19a3fsb\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">I ordered the pad pak reum with chicken and it was so good!
